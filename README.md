## 🚀 Getting Started (Development)

> These steps assume you have **Node.js (v18+)** and a package manager installed. The project uses **pnpm** in dev notes but `npm`/`yarn` will also work.

1. **Install dependencies**

```bash
# with pnpm (recommended)
pnpm install

# or with npm
npm install

# or yarn
yarn install
```

2. **Run the development server**

```bash
pnpm dev
# or
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open your browser at: `http://localhost:3000`

3. **Build for production**

```bash
pnpm build
pnpm start
# or
npm run build
npm run start
```

---

## ⚙️ Available Scripts (from package.json)

- `dev` — Run Next.js development server
- `build` — Build the Next.js production app
- `start` — Start the built production server
- `lint` — Run linter (if configured)
- `format` — Format code (if configured)

> Check `package.json` for exact script names and adjust if needed.

## 🔧 Configuration & Environment Variables

This template does not require secrets by default. If you integrate third-party services (e.g., email provider, CMS, analytics), create a `.env.local` at the project root and add entries like:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPS_KEY=your_maps_api_key_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_ANALYTICS_ID=your_analytics_id
SMTP_USER=you@example.com
SMTP_PASS=supersecret
```

Remember **never** to commit real secrets to the repository.

## 🧪 How to Edit Content

- Pages are inside the `app/` directory — edit `.tsx` files to change copy and structure.
- Reusable UI elements live in `components/` — update these to change how destinations, cards, headers, and footers render.
- Add or replace images in `public/` and reference them with `/your-image.jpg` in your components/pages.
- Tailwind configuration and global CSS entry points are in project files like `postcss.config.mjs` and `app/globals.css` — adjust as needed for design changes.

## 📸 Screenshots (examples)

Screenshots are stored in `public/`. Replace them with your own images to customize the site visuals.

## ♻️ Deploying

You can deploy this Next.js app to many platforms — Vercel and Netlify are the most common choices for Next.js projects.

**Vercel** (recommended for Next.js):
1. Push the repo to GitHub/GitLab.
2. Import the project on Vercel and set the build command to `pnpm build` (or `npm run build`) and the output directory to default (Next.js handles this).
3. Add any required environment variables on the Vercel dashboard.

**Netlify**:
- Use the `next-on-netlify` adapter or build as a static app if your project is exportable.
